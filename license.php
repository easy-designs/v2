  <p>Easy Designs LLC is a proud supporter of the open source software movement and we try to release as much source code for our projects as we can. All of our original work (be they PHP, JavaScript/ECMA Script, ActionScript, CSS, etc.) is available for you to learn from and use. Our designs and the designs we have been paid to provide for our clients, however, are not. &#8220;Borrowing&#8221; or &#8220;appropriating&#8221; our design work is not cool and will not be tolerated.</p>
  <p>Most of the work we feel is worthy of publishing is filed under our <a href="/articles/">articles</a>. It, and all of our <a href="/code/">code</a>, is available under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 License</a>. This license covers everything we do with the exception of design (as mentioned above). The copyright for the design of this site is owned by us and the copyrights for each of the designs we build belong to those clients.</p>
  <p>If you find a way to improve on one of our scripts, please let us know. We&#8217;d love to incorporate your changes and improve the scripts.</p>
